Overview:

The Investment Strategy Simulator is a comprehensive C++ platform designed to simulate and evaluate four distinct investment strategies using historical market data. The project integrates advanced object-oriented programming principles and features a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide users with an intuitive experience for analyzing investment strategies and market trends.

Features:

1. Investment Strategy Simulation
	•	Supports four strategies:
  	•	Set Deposit Strategy: Fixed periodic deposits for consistent investment growth.
  	•	Dividend Payments: Simulates reinvestment of dividends to enhance portfolio performance.
  	•	Moving Average Crossover Strategy: Leverages short- and long-term averages to identify trade signals.
  	•	Momentum-Based Strategy: Analyzes price trends to capture market momentum.

2. Object-Oriented Design
	•	Implemented using core principles of OOP:
  	•	Inheritance: Streamlined relationships between base and derived classes for different strategies.
  	•	Polymorphism: Enabled dynamic behavior for diverse investment approaches.
  	•	Abstract Classes: Provided a flexible framework for modeling strategies.

3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
	•	Seamless program navigation.
	•	Features include:
	•	Graphical representation of portfolio performance.
	•	Visual tracking of price fluctuations over time.
	•	Interactive configuration of simulation parameters.

4. Extensive Codebase
	•	Approximately 5,000 lines of well-structured, documented code.
	•	Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind.
