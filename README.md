Overview:

The Investment Strategy Simulator is a comprehensive C++ platform designed to simulate and evaluate four distinct investment strategies using historical market data. The project integrates advanced object-oriented programming principles and features a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide users with an intuitive experience for analyzing investment strategies and market trends.

Features:

1. Investment Strategy Simulation

The simulator supports four customizable strategies:
- Set Deposit Strategy: Allows fixed periodic deposits to grow the portfolio steadily.
- Dividend Payments: Reinvests dividends automatically to enhance returns.
- Moving Average Crossover Strategy: Utilizes short- and long-term moving averages to identify optimal trade signals.
- Momentum-Based Strategy: Analyzes price trends to capture momentum and maximize returns.

2. Object-Oriented Design
Implemented using core principles of OOP:
- Inheritance: Streamlined relationships between base and derived classes for different strategies.
- Polymorphism: Enabled dynamic behavior for diverse investment approaches.
- Abstract Classes: Provided a flexible framework for modeling strategies.

3. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Features include:
- Graphical representation of portfolio performance.
- Visual tracking of price fluctuations over time.
- Interactive configuration of simulation parameters.

4. Extensive Codebase
- Approximately 5,000 lines of well-structured, documented code.
- Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind.
